public class Ship  {
  /*Create a pirates.Ship class.
The pirates.Ship stores Pirate-s instances in a list as the crew and has one captain who is also a Pirate.
When a ship is created it doesn't have a crew or a captain.
The ship can be filled with pirates and a captain via fillShip() method.
Filling the ship with a captain and random number of pirates.
Ships should be represented in a nice way on command line including information about
captains consumed rum, state (passed out / died)
number of alive pirates in the crew
Ships should have a method to battle other ships: ship.battle(otherShip)
should return true if the actual ship (this) wins
the ship should win if its calculated score is higher
calculate score: Number of Alive pirates in the crew - Number of consumed rum by the captain
The loser crew has a random number of losses (deaths).
The winner captain and crew has a party, including a random number of rum :)*/
